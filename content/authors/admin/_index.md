I am a student in Master's degree of Computer Science and Engineering in Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. I would define myself as creative, multifaceted and curious.\
\
Currently researching in CSIC about engrams and their ability to organise human memory, in order to build novel neural architectures based on them. Also I have worked in the design and implementation of the Central Bank of Spain’s Digital Transformation Strategy. I have proven experience and deep knowledge in the main fields of Computer Science, but my real love is Artificial Intelligence and Computational Theory, that allow me to dabble into more abstract concepts, where I am able to bring out my full potential. My current objective is to continue learning and researching about these fields before pursuing a Ph.D.
