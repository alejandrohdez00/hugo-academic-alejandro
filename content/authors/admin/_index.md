I am a student in Master's degree of Computer Science and Engineering in Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. I would define myself as creative, multifaceted and curious.\
\
I enjoy programming and solving logical and mathematical problems, but at the same time I love to dabble in more abstract and artistic fields through writing and creating stories. Passionate about literature, cinema and videogames.\
\
Really interested in all branches of AI, especially Machine Learning. Currently working on my thesis about Neuroevolution, using evolutionary algorithms to generate optimal artificial neural networks.
